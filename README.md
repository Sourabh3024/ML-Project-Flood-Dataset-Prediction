# ML-Project-Flood-Dataset-Prediction 
# 🌊 Flood Probability Prediction using Machine Learning Python

- This project uses a Kaggle dataset to analyze various flood prediction factors and forecast flood probability using a Machine Learning model. It is entirely self-developed as part of my self-learning journey, with step-by-step guidance and Python code generated with the help of ChatGPT. The complete code has been documented and visualized in a PowerPoint presentation to demonstrate a clear understanding of the project, from data preprocessing to model evaluation and visualization.

#### 🧠 Objective:
To identify and analyze key factors contributing to flood risk and simulate improvement strategies that reduce flood probability.

#### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python (Jupyter Notebook): For model building, visualization, and simulation

- Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn.

#### 📊 Dataset Features
Includes 20+ variables such as:
- Monsoon Intensity
- Urbanization
- Drainage Systems
- River Management
- Deforestation
- Wetland Loss
- Climate Change
- Flood Probability (Target)

#### 💡 Use Cases
- Urban planning & disaster management
- Environmental impact analysis
- Public policy development
- Data science portfolio project
